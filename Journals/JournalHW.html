           <h3>Entry 1</h3>
            The technology rant gave me a new perspective on the idea of portfolio and internet represenations. My current major is exploring physical representations of self, work, and person without the influence of the person mentioned. It feels like it has to be a complete representation of everything that we are. This article challenged that idea, considering the fact that it could also simply be a snippet of what we want to show or a passion that we have. It doesn't have to show fully who we are in totality. That connected with the fact that it is ever changing and a temporary medium, lightens the intensity of the required performance of our portfolio websites.

            For the Schwulst reading, I really connected to the idea of a website being a puddble because a puddle is a representation of many things. The puddle presents the enviornment and things that it has picked up along the way. It is similar to how we are as humans. Even things that we think have fadded or disappeared are still adding to the complexity of our life experience, body and mind.

            handmade web , reminder that anything that is software is actually human made and maintained by humans </p>

<p>Previous web 1990s focused on future and progression. making things better. 

Hand made web correlation between pages and print. her last page linked to the first. remindes me of how web pages are set up. they all lead back to the "front page" the home page. </p>

<p> Handmade web in connection to the manual labor makes me think of the lines of code actually making up the web itself that all link together similar to the pixels required to create an image </p>

<p> I see physical body and the movement of the eyes and the working of the brain that develop the algorithms, systems, and content.  </p>

           <h3>Entry 4</h3>
        <p>
           I found this article interesting due to its descriptive and visual context. I found it interesting how the author used a contrast of natural medium (water color) and a technicological mechanical item. I thought the writer would talk about the mechanical aspects of building a computer in chapter one but, they talked more about the software. I did not expect it to be such an abstract conceptual writing. </p>

<p> I really like how the writer wrote as if she was speaking to us directly. That allowed for me to connect more to the reading. It was interesting to see read about their understanding of the relationship bewteen cities, humans, and computers. I can understand how she connects circuits and cities because everything is interconnected which feeds off each other. It reminds me of Wreck it Ralph and other PC come to life movies that correlate this symmetry. I agree that if the world were a computer it would be really buggy and probably have heating issues. I believe that we can rewire urban spaces to make our own cities because they are starting to do that in Japan with garden buildings. I hope we bring that characteristic over to America so that we can live a more healthy and ecological life. </p>

        <h3>Entry 5</h3>
            <p>
            The first thing I thought about this website was that I felt very overwhelmed. It reminded of being a group chat where you see that everyone is typing and posting while you are trying to get your words out. Its an uncontrolable wave that will pass before you can fully absorb the situation. Because I felt rushed, I did not fully understand how the website worked at first. I found myself feeling lost and confused as more items popped onto the screen.

            I found it so interesting when the website stated, "If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product". It reminds me of the transition that social media has made into selling its users attention as stock. The collective social interaction of people online generates profit for the smaller collection of businesses.

            I did not find the mention of using multiple masks to be only set within the online space. You can walk down the hall talking to someone one way. Stop, talk to another friend, and talk to them differently. I do not think this is unique to the internet. This is very common in the black community when interacting with people from other backgrounds because we tend to use ebonics when talking in our community. We are required to code switch in order to interact with our surroundings in a way that is seen as respectable or presentable. This is similar to how other spoken langauges are pressured to switch to english while walking around in America. </p>

        <h3>Entry 6</h3>
            <p>
            I found the context of this article very interesting because of the various connections of thought that is made. I never knew that there was a collection of people who lived in communes in the 70's. I have only known of racial communities built to increase wealth dynamics of certain groups of people. It is understandable that these communities grew because I believe it was the beginning of mandatory conformity being required of the majority race.
