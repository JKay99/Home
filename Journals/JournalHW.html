           <h3>Entry 1</h3>
            The technology rant gave me a new perspective on the idea of portfolio and internet represenations. My current major is exploring physical representations of self, work, and person without the influence of the person mentioned. It feels like it has to be a complete representation of everything that we are. This article challenged that idea, considering the fact that it could also simply be a snippet of what we want to show or a passion that we have. It doesn't have to show fully who we are in totality. That connected with the fact that it is ever changing and a temporary medium, lightens the intensity of the required performance of our portfolio websites.

            For the Schwulst reading, I really connected to the idea of a website being a puddble because a puddle is a representation of many things. The puddle presents the enviornment and things that it has picked up along the way. It is similar to how we are as humans. Even things that we think have fadded or disappeared are still adding to the complexity of our life experience, body and mind.

            handmade web , reminder that anything that is software is actually human made and maintained by humans </p>

<p>Previous web 1990s focused on future and progression. making things better. 

Hand made web correlation between pages and print. her last page linked to the first. remindes me of how web pages are set up. they all lead back to the "front page" the home page. </p>

<p> Handmade web in connection to the manual labor makes me think of the lines of code actually making up the web itself that all link together similar to the pixels required to create an image </p>

<p> I see physical body and the movement of the eyes and the working of the brain that develop the algorithms, systems, and content.  </p>

           I found this article interesting due to its descriptive and visual context. I found it interesting how the author used a contrast of natural medium (water color) and a technicological mechanical item. I thought the writer would talk about the mechanical aspects of building a computer in chapter one but, they talked more about the software. I did not expect it to be such an abstract conceptual writing. </p>

<p> I really like how the writer wrote as if she was speaking to us directly. That allowed for me to connect more to the reading. It was interesting to see read about their understanding of the relationship bewteen cities, humans, and computers. I can understand how she connects circuits and cities because everything is interconnected which feeds off each other. It reminds me of Wreck it Ralph and other PC come to life movies that correlate this symmetry. I agree that if the world were a computer it would be really buggy and probably have heating issues. I believe that we can wire urban space to make our on cities because they are starting to do that in Japan with garden buildings. I hope we bring that characteristic over to America so that we can live a more healthy and ecological life. </p>
