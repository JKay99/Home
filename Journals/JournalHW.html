           The technology rant gave me a new perspective on the idea of portfolio and internet represenations. My current major is exploring physical representations of self, work, and person without the influence of the person mentioned. It feels like it has to be a complete representation of everything that we are. This article challenged that idea, considering the fact that it could also simply be a snippet of what we want to show or a passion that we have. It doesn't have to show fully who we are in totality. That connected with the fact that it is ever changing and a temporary medium, lightens the intensity of the required performance of our portfolio websites.  
            
            For the Schwulst reading, I really connected to the idea of a website being a puddble because a puddle is a representation of many things. The puddle presents the enviornment and things that it has picked up along the way. It is similar to how we are as humans. Even things that we think have fadded or disappeared are still adding to the complexity of our life experience, body and mind.
