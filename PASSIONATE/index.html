            <p>Entering the workforce these days feels like stepping into a vast buffet of passions. It's like trying to fit a week's worth of food into a single meal, it seems nearly impossible.

The upcoming workforce must learn to adapt as the relentless march of automation requires skill beyond technical proficiency.</p>
