        <p>Spend <a href="https://handmade-web.net/exercises/homepage.html">some</a> time setting up your Homepage. You can design it however you like. Think ahead and consider the content that we will be adding to our Homepages over the course of the class in order to determine the ways that it can grow or adapt to the content being added. But don’t fret too much at this point, the Homepage will hopefully change quite a bit over the course of the class as you learn more. This will be your personal portal to every project that we do in this class. Make it personal! The only requirement is that it’s navigable and that all the links work!</p>
       
        <p>This is a list of things to do while resting</p>

        I try to keep the class open and flexible so that you can explore web design in whatever way interests you the most — and there are many pathways and possibilities when it comes to the web. Because of this, a good portion of the class is driven by your own initiative.
